all_eval_corpus.py: This should report both BLEURT at sentence-level. This contains a catch for BLEURT, if you don't
have the checkpoint for it, it will download it for you. But if for some reason, this still cause issues, you can 
check the page directly: https://github.com/google-research/bleurt

comprehensive_script.py: This should report all metrics along with the actual text. So the reference and candidate 
sentences along with BLEURT (sentence-level, scale of 0 to 1), BLEU (corpus-level and reported in the classic 
manner here, a scale of 0 to 1), and ChrF (corpus-level, scale of 0 to 100).

Word_is_present.py: Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Can be used for both single word presence
or multiple word presence. 

reverse_order_eval: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

All code is heavily commented and has a lot of error checks.
